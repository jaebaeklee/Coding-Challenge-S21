## ANSWER ONE

Outputs map.png given user input of a genbank (.gb) file. Wasn't sure how to properly credit, or how liscences work? But used the GView Library. Including gview.jar (external jar library) for reference in branch. GView also requires piccolo2D, but piccolo2D does not come with an external jar, just its own source. I tried running this one without adding piccolo to the build path, and it ran fine. Not sure whether that is becuase I'm stupid and am just misunderstanding something, so let me know if it doens't work on your machine.

Already ran it, example png is in map.png in the src folder.

Coded using Java.

For reference to solution, basically just used the GView library and it basically coded itself. Wasn't sure exactly what a genome map is? Or what features are supposed to be labeled or what not, so just used default values given in GView. Accepts all genbank files.
